  * Pre-trained on VGGFace2
  * Feature extraction
  * Face embeddings
- Transfer Learning Strategy
  * Frozen pre-trained weights
  * KNN classifier for face recognition

Slide 4: Data Pipeline
Flow diagram:
1. Data Collection
2. Augmentation
3. Face Detection (MTCNN)
4. Feature Extraction
5. Classification (KNN)

Code example:
augmentation_pipeline = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=15),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2),
    transforms.Resize((160, 160)),
])

Slide 5: Data Augmentation
Techniques Applied:
- Random horizontal flips
- Rotation (±15 degrees)
- Brightness/contrast adjustment
- Consistent sizing (160x160)

Results:
- 5x increase in training data
- Improved model robustness
- Better handling of variations

Slide 6: Model Implementation
Code snippet:
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
mtcnn = MTCNN(keep_all=False, device=device)
resnet = InceptionResnetV1(pretrained='vggface2').eval().to(device)
embedding = resnet(face.unsqueeze(0).to(device))

Slide 7: Training Process
Steps:
1. Face Detection using MTCNN
2. Feature Extraction using FaceNet
3. KNN Training (n_neighbors=3)

Code:
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(train_embeddings, train_labels)
